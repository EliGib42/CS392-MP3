                    Job? Me? Work a 9 to 5? Are you serious? I'll tell you what I did for a living but it wasn't very
                    pleasant. A whole lot of stealing and murder was what kept me going! Admittedly, I am a truly gifted
                    actor in addition to being known for my humble nature. I regularly have to pretend to be a normal
                    Doll that definitely is NOT possessed by the soul of a killer, and when I do that I manage to fool
                    even the smartest of idiots
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                And let's not forget that I'm the star of the show! All those movies and all that money wouldn't have
                been possible if it wasn't for yours truly. My incredible wit and oneliners always leaves the audience
                coming back and begging for more, and my angry, flamboyant flare is why I always come back. Like I said
                in my 4th movie, "I'm one of the most notorious slashers in history! I am Chucky! The killer doll!
                And I dig it!"
