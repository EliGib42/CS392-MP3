                    School? Glad you asked, I've been to school a number of times in fact! Back when I was a normal
                    human I went through all the typical schooling a young kid goes through, and more again when I was
                    in doll form to make sure the victims there all had killer days! I'll provide all my education
                    material below so you can appreciate it
