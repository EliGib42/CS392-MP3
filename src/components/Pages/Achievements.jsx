                    My Achievements are as varied as they are many. For decades I was the terror of New Jersey, my home
                    town of Hackensack knew me as quite the terror! According to the internet, I killed 192 people in my
                    human and doll forms, which sure is something! Speaking of the doll form, I was able to put my soul into
                    a good guy doll I found as I lay dying on the ground, which allowed me to cheat death forever. I'd like
                    to see you pull that off!

                And lets talk movies. In my franchise I have 7 main movies and a TV show that ran for 3 seasons, making
                over $250 Million at the box office and a ton more from streaming subscriptions. Hell, in one of the movies
                about me they make an in universe movie about me, that's movieception! Can you think of any other horror
                icons with a movie within a movie about them (pretend Scream doesn't exist please).
