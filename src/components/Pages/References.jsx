                    Of course I have references! I'm a famous killer who likes to have fun, not some loner loser like
                    Michael Myers of Jason Voorhees. I got all kinds of friends and family who love me and would die
                    for me (sometimes literally). Below is a list of all my favorite people and how you can contact
                    them so they can tell you firsthand how amazing I am!
